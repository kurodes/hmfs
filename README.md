Since GitHub currently does not support sharing private repositories via a
special link (see related
[discussion](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/44506)), we have to
use an alternative method to share the artifact with the reproducibility
committee. Please follow these steps to access and review the artifact:

1. Download the zip file from the following link:
   [Artifact Zip File](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gJR-OPIzlLOQAcc06SFC9V-PkczUAhj2/view?usp=sharing).

2. Extract the artifact using the password, which is exactly the title of
   section 3.2 in the paper. Specifically, if the section title is "3.2 xxx"
   then the password is "xxx"
